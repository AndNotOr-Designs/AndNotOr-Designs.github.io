I'm a hobbyist that dabbles in arduino and python. By day I'm an Audio Visual integrator that uses both AMX and Crestron programming. 


# Projects

## Adafruit's Macropad
- This was part of an AdaBox shipment and I used it to create an additional keypad for standard keyboard shortcuts
- I followed Adafruit's learn guide for the [MACROPAD Hotkeys](https://learn.adafruit.com/macropad-hotkeys)
- I made some changes with [additional features](https://github.com/AndNotOr-Designs/macroPad)
- Still want to get non Ascii text to show on the display, but working with Adafruit's forum to get others to help
## Chicken Coop sensors
- We have 5 chickens in our backyard and we built it right when I was starting with Arduino
- [Environmental sensors along with some timing](https://github.com/AndNotOr-Designs/Coop-Master)
- This sends information to ThingSpeak making [IoT](https://thingspeak.com/channels/605978/private_show)
- This also talks with the next project for communicating coop door opening in the morning
## Chicken Coop door
- [Controls](https://github.com/AndNotOr-Designs/Coop-Door) for opening and closing the coop door so we don't have to go outside during nasty weather
- This also communicates with ThingSpeak for door status and [troubleshooting codes](https://thingspeak.com/channels/1244287/private_show)
## Hand sanitizer dispenser
- [Touchless hand sanitizer dispenser](https://github.com/AndNotOr-Designs/sanitizerDispenser)
